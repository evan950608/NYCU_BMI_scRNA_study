Zheng PBMC methods (2017)

Source
we obtained fresh PBMCs from a healthy donor (Donor A).
8–9k cells were captured from each of 8 channels and pooled to obtain B68k cells.

PCA and tSNE analysis of PBMCs
PCA: run on the normalized gene-barcode of the top 1000 most variable genes. (ranked by dispersion)
UMI normalization: dividing UMI counts by the total UMI counts in each cell, followed by multiplication with the median of the total UMI counts across cells.
Natural log of UMI counts.
Each gene was normalized such that the mean signal for each gene is 0, and standard deviation is 1.
t-SNE on the first 50 PCs


Identification of cluster-specific genes and marker-based classification
Identify genes that are enriched in a specific cluster
	the mean expression of each gene was calculated across all cells in the cluster.
	each gene from the cluster was compared to the median expression of the same gene from cells in all other clusters.
	Genes were ranked based on their expression difference, and the top 10 enriched genes from each cluster were selected.
	Hierarchical clustering of each cluster. calculate the pair-wise correlation between each cluster.

Cell classification analysis using purified PBMCs
We classified 68k PBMCs based on their best match to the average expression profile of 11 reference transcriptomes
cluster with Seurat: While it was able to distinguish inferred CD4þ naive from inferred CD8þ naive T cells, it was not able to cleanly separate out inferred activated cytotoxic T cells from inferred NK cells.


Important cell markers
	T cells: CD3D
		CD8, CD4
		T memory: CCR10
		T regulatory: TNFRSF18
		ID3: important in maintaining a naive T-cell state
	NK: NKG7
	B: CD79A
	myeloid cells (Mono, DC): S100A8 and S100A9
	Dendritic cells: FCER1A
	CD34: progenitor and differentiation markers (hematopoietic progenitors)
	megakaryocytes: PF4
